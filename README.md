# Option-Chain-Assessment

This project provides a Python-based solution for obtaining option chain data and calculating margin requirements and premiums using the Upstox API. This script demonstrates how to authenticate with Upstox, retrieve option chain data, and perform calculations on the data. The project is divided into three main steps, explained below.

Prerequisites
Upstox Account and API Credentials: Create an account on Upstox (or any supported trading platform) and set up an API application to obtain the client_id, client_secret, and access token.
Python Packages:
requests: For making API requests.
pandas: For data manipulation.
Install dependencies using pip install requests pandas.

Steps
Step 1: Obtain Access Token
To access the Upstox API, you need to authenticate and retrieve an access token. Replace the placeholders in the code with your own client_id, client_secret, code, and redirect_uri.
